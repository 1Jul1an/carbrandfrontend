# 🚗 VELOCITY – A High-Performance Frontend Showcase

**VELOCITY** is a fictional high-performance sports car brand, crafted as a visual and technical demonstration of modern frontend development.  
It mimics the design quality and structural polish of luxury automotive sites like Porsche or Ferrari – but built entirely as a code-based concept.

This project highlights advanced frontend architecture, component-based design, motion, theming, and presentation strategy.
